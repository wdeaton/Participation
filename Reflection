This assignment was definitely stressful to say the least. It was very challenging and yet very rewarding in the end. When it comes to homework, I feel I put more time in this assignment than any other assignment from all my other classes combined. It was definitely harder and more fun than I thought it would be. 

Something I learned, was how to work with Jeckyll from Github, or at least have a much better understanding. 

I am still confused on how to make a folder in Github so I can clump my blogs repositories together
