One thing I feel I have adequate knowledge in is farming and GMO's. Since my blog is about GMO's ill take about them.
GMO stands for Genetically Modified Organism, not to be confused with GE's or gentically engineered. 
Examples of GMOs can be corn, soybeans, and even some animals. For instance there is a quial called the Texas A&M quail that is genetically modified to produce more meat. They are delicious. 
The big hype of GMOs is wether or not they are safe or even something we should mess with.
  1. All the major universities and research centers have proven GMOs to be safe to use, but they can not prove the test of time. We know     GMOs to be safe but they have not been tested against time due to our inability to do that. GMOs have been around for a long time         though. 
  2. Some call GMOs to question escecailly that humans are playing God. Is it right for us to create something He did not. Others argue       that He gave us the ideas to do this and that we must proceed further. 
Farmers have to feed the world, and the US is one of the best places to farm. Our soil here is ideal for growing crops and we do have more farmland that other countries. However, our farmland is been reduced yearly to make room for new things, houses, roads, cities, and more. Due to this new shortage of land, farmers have to grow more on less land. GMOs are the only way to do this. They allow for more yeilds to be harvested on less land, with less pesticides, and less maintenance. The world is growing and GMOs are the only way to feed it. 
GMOs are made by inserting specific genes into organisms that do not already have them. For example, corn now has a gene that makes it less likely to be eaten by meal worms. A meal worm infestation can destroy and entire crop. In the past the only way to rid these pests was to spray pesticides on them. 
The alternative to GMO is organic farming, to those who have never organic farmed, dont, it sucks.
