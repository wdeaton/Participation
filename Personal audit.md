# Habits 

My writing habits are to sit down and dish the whole thing out. I will set myself with plenty of time to do the assignment but I also let myself get distracted. I do tend to get distracted, have a great insight, write it down, go off on my idea then slowly distract myself again. It seems like a misjumbled way to write but it works. I did not have the best habits. I tended to procastinate too. 

# Imporvements

I have been imporving my habits by starting sooner, then rewarding myself for not procastinating. So I will work for awhile then let my self get distracted and work on it another time. I have been more motivated to write now that i know its not going to be critiqued so hard. Meaning I feel better about writing knowing that I am not going to get destroyed on my paper just because I had a few wrong words in it. 

# Strengths

One strength is that i like to write mine in the morning with a little pressure to help me focus. Thats when I write best.
